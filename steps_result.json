The group has identified 20 sites exposed to water stress risks and 67 sites exposed to extreme weather events. \n\n2. To address water stress, Solvay has developed mitigation plans for all relevant sites, scheduling implementation for 2019-2022, which include water reduction or recycling projects. \n\n3. For the sites exposed to extreme weather events, they have implemented contingency plans focusing on flood or hurricane scenarios. The facilities have been evaluated for risks such as operations, human safety, and insurance, and response plans have been tested at plants located in areas highly exposed to climate hazards.\n\n4. Solvay has defined a set of proprietary Climate Physical Categories to ensure the robustness of these response plans and validation of the results through audits or site tests.\n\nConsidering these strategies, Solvay can be rated at Level 3 as they have a comprehensive adaptation strategy and invest in resilient infrastructure .",
